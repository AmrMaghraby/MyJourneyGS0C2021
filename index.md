## Welcome to My Blog

# Week 1

 Implemented Localization Network in STN (to be able to solve challenges like rotation challenge).

# Week 2 

 Implemented CNN (First Module) and connected it to SVM implemented by me also.
 
 Tried Different architectures and pre-trained CNN to see which one is more effective and getting higher accuracy.

# week 3 - 8

 From This week I started to ran about 21 Experiemnt till now to select the best one with best architecture. 
 
 Experiement 1:
  
  I have implemented  CNN with the following specs :
  Data --> Conv1 --> ReLU --> Pool1 --> Conv2 --> ReLU --> Fc3 --> ReLU --> Fc4 --> ReLU --> SVM
  
  This got Accuracy About ~= 55%
 
 Experiement 2:
 
  I have implemented  CNN with the following specs :
  Data --> Conv1 --> ReLU --> Pool1 --> Conv2 --> ReLU --> Conv3 --> ReLU --> Fc4 --> ReLU --> Fc5 --> ReLU --> SVM
  
  This got Accuracy About ~= 55%
 
 Experiement 3:

  I have implemented  CNN with the following specs :
